The United States and Trump are words that are also obvious to be used, since they are about the U.S. as a state and Trump's presidency. What is interesting is the words that follow, which are Mexico, Republican, American, and Texas.  Mexico is frequently mentioned, mostly because Trump built the wall in the Mexico-US border area. Texas is frequently mentioned as well, in which Texas happens to be the first border project that Trump built during his presidency. This shows that in the narrative of most articles, Mexico as the main border in which Trump built the wall has always dominated the narrative. The word Republican and American that are used also depict the political party that endorsed this project.  Meanwhile, Texas as Trump's first wall/border project also dominated the trump and border discourse."
